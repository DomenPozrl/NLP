# NLP
This repo is for the project in the Obdelava naravnega jezika class

**Data parsing** directory contains two python files. One parses the data and the other prints some basic statistics of the dataset.

**Attribute retrieval** directory contains all the code used to construct attributes for the data. Before running any other code the files from this directory have to be run in this order:
  - props1.py
  - props2.py
  - props3.py
  - props4.py
  - get_znacilke.py
  - order_data_for_learning.py

**Neural network**
This part was developed with the use of resources from the NLP class and is now no longer functional. The results are presented in the report.

**CRF** directory contains code used for data preparation (5 distinct experiments), hyper-parameter 
tuning and cross validation of the CRF model. Read CRF/README.md for instructions on how to use it.
